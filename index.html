			<p id="imp">The Story of <span style="color: #AE0BBC;">Harry Potter</span> is perhaps one of the best-selling and most admired series of books in the history of mankind. Based on this literary masterpiece, 8 feature films were made, games were created, and theme parks were opened. A series of books about Harry Potter should be read in chronological order to feel the development of the characters and the essence of the story itself. In total, the series includes 7 books. The first part is aimed at a children's audience, and it is very easy to read. But with each new book, the plot gets darker. The author of the novel, J. K. Rowling, assumed that children would grow up with her story, so by the last books, the life of the main characters takes on more and more bloody shades. To prepare yourself for this turn of events, you should start with the first part.</p>
